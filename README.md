### KickOff meeting
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sboqV94eDzEiKEs8Lh4W6DTSlwJMIczww0Kpv1__cU4/edit#
- Lecture organizer/viewer
- House/organize daily schedule/videos (replace spreadsheets, Piazza)
- Can sort lectures by topics, upvote, basically similar functionality to Piazza but more friendly (and more video-focused)
- Slackbot to expose/share, make it more efficient to find recent videos
  - Use Slackbot to send videos to the app?
  - Automate other tasks w/Slack
  - Still probably have separate webapp, but heavy Slack integration possibly
- Feature: reminder to upload video, *maybe* even upload automatically (could be extended to another project idea itself)
- Challenge: app would have to accommodate delay in video upload/processing
- Challenge: permissions, auth, acl, etc.
