### KickOff meeting

#### Lecture organizer/viewer
- House/organize daily schedule/videos (replace spreadsheets, Piazza)
- Can sort lectures by topics, upvote, basically similar functionality to Piazza but more friendly (and more video-focused)
- Slackbot to expose/share, make it more efficient to find recent videos
  - Use Slackbot to send videos to the app?
  - Automate other tasks w/Slack
  - Still probably have separate webapp, but heavy Slack integration possibly
- Feature: reminder to upload video, *maybe* even upload automatically (could be extended to another project idea itself)
- Challenge: app would have to accommodate delay in video upload/processing
- Challenge: permissions, auth, acl, etc.

> Please chat amongst your group, form a private slack channel (wacky team names encouraged), and invite your lecturer. Once that's all set, you'll work with them to continue getting repos/boilerplate set up.

> Immediate goals: grouped with Slack channel and GitHub org, basic boilerplate repo (with initial tech decisions) created. Tomorrow you'll start getting Agile, set up Trello, do issue estimation/prioritization/assignment. From Wednesday on - code!

> We want groups to work independently, so you get a feel for the "real world" of software engineering - we will of course be available, and if you're blocked don't hesitate to reach out, but don't feel like you need our sign off for everything either. See us as stakeholders who want to see your project delivered (and help you make high level decisions), but not fulltime micromanagers who need to know every detail along the way.

> Your group should self-organize and coordinate a schedule that works for you, and invite us (the lecturers) to your meetings - we won't attend every one, but should make it to Monday (sprint planning) and Friday (demo/review). Tues-Thurs you should have standups in the morning, which lecturers may or may not attend as time allows. We'll go over more details about this process tomorrow.

> Also, as we get going with a full git workflow (branching, merging pull requests) we want to encourage you to involve TAs as code reviewers. They probably know more about React Native and such than I do at least, and can help you make good decisions as you work day to day. Again, more details tomorrow, but wanted to give you all a high level picture now so you know what to expect.

> If you have any concerns about any of the above - group assignments, schedule, process, etc. - please DM me as soon as possible.

> One other good initial task (once you have a slack channel) - copy the section of the kickoff doc corresponding to your project, make a new doc, and elaborate on it together. Keep brainstorming, but also start taking a more critical/realistic eye to narrow scope and really define what it is you want to achieve over the next ~4-6 weeks.
