Hello.

My name is Patrick Kennedy.

Our group is called "Arc Hive" and we've created a tool which
Automates Streaming Content Creation, Dissemination, Archive and Retrieval.

Currently, getting Zoom meetings uploaded to YouTube and the links disseminated
to students is a time consuming and manually cumbersome process.

Our main goals with this project were to:
1) make it easier for teachers to get recordings of Zoom lecture videos posted on YouTube and
2) make it easier for students to retrieve links to these lectures.

Using the Slack, Zoom, YouTube and AirTable APIs, we've deployed an automated
toolset which allows authorized teachers to launch a Zoom meeting. The
Zoom meeting link gets posted in Slack to the specific classes channel.
Once the Zoom meeting is done recording, our server application transfers the recording
to YouTube; the YouTube link is then  posted to the cohort's Slack channel and the meeting
is archived for future reference in AirTable.

Finally, our toolset lets students retrieve either a chronological listing
of all the recorded meetings, or, students can search for specific meetings
based on tags from our content based management.
